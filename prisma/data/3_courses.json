    "description": "This course introduces students to the fundamentals of digital business, technologies and the principles and practices that lead to successful digital transformation. With the exploitation of digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, cloud, analytics, mobile networks, social media, and the Internet of Things, organizations can develop a competitive edge that can boost efficiency and drive new business models that lead to an increase in the top and bottom lines. The course focuses on digital strategies using four components namely reimagining the business, re-evaluating value chain, reconnecting with customers and rebuilding the organisation. Challenges such as data security and governance, regulatory constraints, and future directions of digital business will be discussed. Besides helping students to understand the key concepts, tools and API services are introduced to implement the digital and analytics solutions. Real world examples and case studies of how organizations innovate and drive digital transformation will also be covered.",

Their minds will be open to the wonders of computing, as they go behind the scene to unravel the fundamental analytics that empower Google, consulting agencies and service companies.\n\nNOTE: To facilitate learning in this course, you are required to know and use programming.  You are advised to pick up the Python programming language before the course, for instance by practising with online tutorials such as http://learnpython.org.\n\nBy taking this course, students will:\n• discover the science of computing\n• model problems and learn practical problem-solving techniques to tackle complex computational problems (beyond what a spreadsheet is capable of solving)\n• apply problem-solving techniques to develop more elegant and efficient programs\n• learn to write programs to represent and manipulate with complex data objects\n• understand the challenge of scale, not only in dealing with large data sets, but also in appreciating the nature of computing and computability",

This course will consider the rules and processes which the law has developed to address this ever-present problem, with a focus on debtors which are companies. In particular it will cover, in more depth than in LAW205, the formal processes available in Singapore – receivership, schemes of arrangement, judicial management and liquidation (winding up). In those contexts, the substantive policies and principles of the law will be addressed – e.g. , the pari passu principle, the concept of set-off, and the avoidance of suspect transactions entered in the run-up to insolvency. In addition, the course will consider informal debt restructurings (work-outs), and also introduce the issues and developing law relating to cross-border insolvencies. As well as providing a theoretical grounding in corporate insolvency principles, it is expected that aspects of the course will involve the participation of specialist insolvency lawyers from private practice, with the aim of providing a practical perspective.\nAlthough the primary focus will be on corporate insolvency, comparison will be made with the procedures and rules applicable in the bankruptcy of individuals. It is likely that before or during the period of the course the Government will publish a draft Insolvency Bill combining and amending the rules applicable to both individual and corporate insolvency. If so, the course will take those proposals into account.",

Japan was the first non-Western country to industrialize and to establish the democratic institutions. However, unlike most Western democracies, Japan maintained a mixture of democratic procedures, one-party dominance, alliance with U.S. military, high-level of economic growth, and social security from 1955 to 1993. Since to early 1993, many of mainstays of the previous system have collapsed and new institutions have established: coalition government, electoral reform, the bubble economy, etc. Following the experience of ‘Japanese miracle,’ the second half of the twentieth century has seen South Korea transformed from an impoverished, war-ravaged nation to one of the most successful economies in East Asian region. This has been accompanied by a political transformation from a military authoritarian regime to a vibrant democracy. While most analyses of Korean politics have looked to elites to explain political change, this course is designed to examine new challenges to political power structure of Korea in the age of transformation.",
