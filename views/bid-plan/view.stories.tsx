 * Stories for the bid-plan View (mcp-use v2).

 * Seeding mechanism: the shared `.storybook/withMcpView` decorator wraps each
 * story in the seed context consumed by the webpack-aliased
 * `.storybook/mocks/mcp-use-react.ts` module (the real v2 hooks require the
 * module-private bootstrapView runtime that only exists inside an MCP Apps
 * host, so Storybook runs against seeded implementations instead).
